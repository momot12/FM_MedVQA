It is a widely used method in microbiology for identifying and classifying bacteria. The stain is applied to a thin smear of bacteria, and the cells are then examined under a microscope. The stain binds to different components of the cell wall, resulting in distinct colors and patterns for each group of bacteria. In the case of gram-positive bacteria, the cell wall contains peptidoglycan, which binds to the crystal violet dye, resulting in a purple color. Gram-negative bacteria, on the other hand, have a thin layer of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharide, which binds to the safranin dye, resulting in a red color. This staining technique helps to differentiate between the two groups of bacteria and provides valuable information for diagnosis and treatment."},
