The presence of fluid in the pancreas can also be a sign of an infection or an underlying medical condition that requires immediate attention."},
{"question_id": 398, "question": "why is the pancreas abnormal?", "question_type": "OTHER", "answer_pred": "The pancreas is abnormal because it is missing a portion of its outer layer, which is typically present in all pancreases. This missing outer layer is called the exocrine layer, which is responsible for producing and secreting digestive enzymes and hormones. Without this layer, the pancreas is unable to function properly, leading to various health issues such as diabetes, pancreatitis, and other digestive problems.
